# Blockstudio Boilerplate
A deeply opinionated way to get started with WordPress and Blockstudio.

The project will be renamed at in the future. It's far more than a boilerplate.

## Requirements
As long as you're committed to WordPress and building blocks with Blockstudio, you'll find useful tidbits in this project. 
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
- [Blockstudio](https://blockstudio.dev/)

## Getting Started

## Theme
Includes an opinionated theme intended to be extended by a required companion plugin. 

### Root Files

### Template Files

### Parts

### Patterns

### Assets

#### Fonts

## Plugin

### 📁 Assets

#### 📁 Icons

#### 📁 Images

#### 📁 Styles

#### 📁 Scripts

### 📁 Blocks

### 📁 Experiences
I use the term "experiences" to describe how users can interact with the site, from logged-out visitors to logged-in admins. 

Each directory in the `experiences` tends to represent a broad, encapsulating set of features that may span 0 or more post types, taxonomies, custom field groups, and more. 

Most projects will bundle these directories in an `includes` folder. You do you, though.

Directories I typically include:
- Reading
- Writing
- Editing
- Branding

### 📁 Plugins

### 📁 Vendors

## My Stack
I may use these solutions as representative services to build blocks to demonstrate capabilities.

If you don't like what I picked, you're on your own to find an alternative. If I don't use it, I'm not going to recommend it. And, I'm not going to add anything to the project that I can't personally provide support for.
